<p align="justify"> Falls are a major health problem nowadays, since they are the
leading cause of injury and hospital admission among seniors.
In 2010, 71.2% of emergency department visits among persons aged
65 years and older were related to falls, where as for the total
population the percentage was 35.7.i  This has caused an interest
shift to fall detection applications that can effectively identify falls
and alert all interested parties.</p>

<p align="justify">This work being developed with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lefteris-skandalellis-b56a36ba" target="_blank">Lefteris Skandalellis</a>
 is focused on creating a complete and realistic solution to fall detection.
 We create an Android Application that can be run on an android smart-device that
 sends data into an integrated server. The server collects the data and uses them
 into a threshold based fall detection algorithm to identify potentially dangerous
 situations. The alerts are then forwarded to the interested individual’s smartphone.
 Special focus is given in creating a lightweight client in order to be able to prolong
 smart-device’s battery life, since constant sensor data collection significantly
 contribute to the total power consumption of the device.
